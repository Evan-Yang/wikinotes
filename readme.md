things to not forget etc

* bugs in twitter bootstrap: margins for modals, and that font-weight or line-height or something that i can't find anymore
* make the fullscreen option for section-body work (the 100% - n pixels thing, use divs within a div for that)
* when adding new sections (beyond the initial 10), remember to change the ids, names and <span>n</span>s
* either the "add another section" button or the preview+save buttons are not centered 
* delete icon (top right corner) for sections (like the modal dialogue close icons)
* adding a section should update the number in the num_sections dropdown
* capitalisation of term. it's actually really important
