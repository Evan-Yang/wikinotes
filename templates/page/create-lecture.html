		<h2>This should be an input box</h2>
		<p>This should be the same for several things ... depends on the number of sections only. One such box for each section perhaps? With a header, and a place to enter shit.</p>
	</div>
	<br />
	<div>
		<h2>Another input box, enter the header</h2>
		<p>You know what would be really cool? If we auto-staged files, in case the user accidentally closes the browser or something. So then when that user comes back to the page, it will show that the user has staged but not committed some changes. Like auto-save, basically, but with an extra step needed to confirm etc.</p>
	</div>
	<br />
	<div>
		<h2>Need to style input boxes</h2>
		<p>And textareas etc. Too ugly right now.</p>
	</div>
	<br />
	<div>
		<h2>On how to save files</h2>
		<p>For regular things with sections: take the section header (specified in a larger input box, above) and make that an h2, like you see above, in markdown format. (That should automatically be ID'ed, maybe prefixed with something like Gollum was going to do.) Basically save that within the file, at the top of file. It works, really. And for things with questions (i.e. past exams), either merge the question and answer into one file or keep them as two files but merge them into one div. To think about later.</p>
